        <p>
          This Data Protection Notice sets out the basis which Radiance
          Aesthetic may collect, use, disclose or otherwise process personal
          data of our customers in accordance with the Personal Data Protection
          Act. Please read them carefully.
        </p>
        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          Radiance Aesthetic value its clients and their privacy. Your visit to
          our website and the use of any service we provide is subject to the
          conditions of this privacy policy. This Notice applies to personal
          data in our possession or under our control, including personal data
          in the possession of organisations which we have engaged to collect,
          use, disclose or process personal data for our purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          As used in this Notice, “customer” means an individual who has either
          contacted us through any means to find out more about any goods or
          services we provide, or may, or has, entered into a contract with us
          for the supply of any goods or services by us; and “personal data”
          means data, whether true or not, about a customer who can be
          identified: either from that data, or from that data and other
          information to which we have or are likely to have access. Depending
          on the nature of your interaction with us, some examples of personal
          data which we may collect from you include name, email address,
          telephone number, gender and date of birth. Other terms used in this
          Notice shall have the meanings given to them in the PDPA (where the
          context so permits).
        </p>
        <h2>Collection, use and disclosure of personal data</h2>
        <p>
          We generally do not collect your personal data unless it is either
          provided to us voluntarily by you directly or via a third party who
          has been duly authorised by you to disclose your personal data to us
          (your “authorised representative”) after you (or your authorised
          representative) have been notified of the purposes for which the data
          is collected, and you (or your authorised representative) have
          provided written consent to the collection and usage of your personal
          data for those purposes, or collection and use of personal data
          without consent is permitted or required by the PDPA or other laws. We
          shall seek your consent before collecting any additional personal data
          and before using your personal data for a purpose which has not been
          notified to you (except where permitted or authorised by law).
        </p>
        <p>
          We may collect and use your personal data for performing obligations
          in the course of or in connection with our provision of the goods
          and/or services requested by you, verifying your identity, responding
          to, handling, and processing queries, requests, applications,
          complaints, and feedback from you, managing your relationship with
          Radiance Aesthetic, processing payment or credit transactions during
          checkout, complying with any applicable laws, regulations, codes of
          practice, guidelines, or rules, or to assist in law enforcement and
          investigations conducted by any governmental and/or regulatory
          authority, any other purposes for which you have provided the
          information, any other incidental business purposes related to or in
          connection with the above.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may disclose your personal data where such disclosure is required
          for performing obligations in the course of or in connection with our
          provision of the goods and services requested by you. The collection,
          use and disclosure of persornal data may continue to apply even in
          situations where your relationship with us (for example, pursuant to a
          contract) has been terminated or altered in any way, for a reasonable
          period thereafter (including, where applicable, a period to enable us
          to enforce our rights under a contract with you).
        </p>
        <h2>Reliance on the legitimate interests exception</h2>
        <p>
          We may collect, use or disclose your personal data without your
          consent for the legitimate interests of Radiance Aesthetic or another
          person. In relying on the legitimate interests exception of the PDPA,
          Radiance Aesthetic will assess the likely adverse effects on the
          individual and determine that the legitimate interests outweigh any
          adverse effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          In line with the legitimate interests' exception, we will collect, use
          or disclose your personal data for fraud detection and prevention,
          detection and prevention of misuse of services, network analysis to
          prevent fraud and financial crime, and perform credit analysis, and
          collection and use of personal data on company-issued devices to
          prevent data loss.
        </p>
        <h2>Access to and correction of personal data</h2>
        <p>
          If you wish to make either an access request for access to a copy of
          the personal data which we hold about you or information about the
          ways in which we use or disclose your personal data, or a correction
          request to correct or update any of your personal data which we hold
          about you, you may submit your request in writing or via email to our
          Data Protection Officer at the contact details provided below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that a reasonable fee may be charged for an access
          request. If so, we will inform you of the fee before processing your
          request.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will respond to your request as soon as reasonably possible. In
          general, our response will be within thirty (30) business days. Should
          we not be able to respond to your request within thirty (30) days
          after receiving your request, we will inform you in writing within
          thirty (30) days of the time by which we will be able to respond to
          your request. If we are unable to provide you with any personal data
          or to make a correction requested by you, we shall generally inform
          you of the reasons why we are unable to do so (except where we are not
          required to do so under the PDPA).
        </p>
        <h2>Data protection</h2>
        <p>
          To safeguard your personal data from unauthorised access, collection,
          use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks, we
          have introduced appropriate administrative, physical and technical
          measures such as minimised collection of personal data, authentication
          and access controls (such as good password practices, need-to-basis
          for data disclosure, etc.), encryption of data, data anonymisation,
          up-to-date antivirus protection, regular patching of operating system
          and other software, securely erase storage media in devices before
          disposal, web security measures against risks, usage of one time
          password(otp)/2 factor authentication (2fa)/multi-factor
          authentication (mfa) to secure access, and security review and testing
          performed regularly.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the
          Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. While
          security cannot be guaranteed, we strive to protect the security of
          your information and are constantly reviewing and enhancing our
          information security measures.
        </p>
        <h2>Data accuracy</h2>
        <p>
          We generally rely on personal data provided by you (or your authorised
          representative). In order to ensure that your personal data is
          current, complete and accurate, please update us if there are changes
          to your personal data by informing our Data Protection Officer in
          writing or via email at the contact details provided below.
        </p>
        <h2>Data retention</h2>
        <p>
          We may retain your personal data for as long as it is necessary to
          fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, or as required or
          permitted by applicable laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will cease to retain your personal data, or remove the means by
          which the data can be associated with you, as soon as it is reasonable
          to assume that such retention no longer serves the purpose for which
          the personal data was collected, and is no longer necessary for legal
          or business purposes.
        </p>
        <h2>Transfers of personal data outside Singapore</h2>
        <p>
          We generally do not transfer your personal data to countries outside
          of Singapore. However, if we do so, we will obtain your consent for
          the transfer to be made and we will take steps to ensure that your
          personal data continues to receive a standard of protection that is at
          least comparable to that provided under the PDPA.
        </p>
        <h2>Data protection officer</h2>
        <p>
          You may contact our Data Protection Officer if you have any enquiries
          or feedback on our personal data protection policies and procedures,
          or if you wish to make any request, in the following manner:

        <h2>Effect of notice and changes to notice</h2>
        <p>
          This Notice applies in conjunction with any other notices, contractual
          clauses and consent clauses that apply in relation to the collection,
          use and disclosure of your personal data by us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may revise this Notice from time to time without any prior notice.
          You may determine if any such revision has taken place by referring to
          the date on which this Notice was last updated. Your continued use of
          our services constitutes your acknowledgement and acceptance of such
          changes.
